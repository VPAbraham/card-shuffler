# Card Shuffler

Developed for a coding challenge, Card Shuffler combines React, Typescript, SASS, and the Bulma CSS library to create a simple, yet dry utilization of SPA UI practices. The app consumes the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) for card data and images of the cards.

# Deployment

The application has been deployed via Google Firebase Hosting and [can be visited here](https://card-shuffler.web.app/).
A good tutorial on how to deploy your own React application [can be viewed here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/firebase-deploy-react-js).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`
After cloning the repository, run this in the root directory to install all relevant dependencies.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint or Typescript errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Further Info

Stretch goals of this project were to get more experience building an app from the ground up in Typescript and to utilize a CSS framework, as I normally write all my own styles. 
I found Bulma to be generally easy to pick up and have a lot of tools for reusable and responsive styling.

## Icebox

Some further goals to continue in this project would include to make improvements to the overall design. It could benefit from more styling and additional media queries to make resizing smoother. With more time, I believe I would be able to learn how to accomplish this in Bulma.

Another would be to add more utility to the card shuffling, perhaps to let users play games with the hands they are dealt such as Blackjack or to allow users to freeze a card to not be included in the shuffle. With so many card games out there, there are no shortage of potential feature additions.
